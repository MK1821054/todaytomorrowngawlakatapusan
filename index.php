     Series of incompetent responses were executed by the government and their continuous
     deprioritization leads the state to rapidly increase the Coronavirus cases in the
     Philippines. As the arising of this worldwide pandemic crisis, the Philippine government
     makes one of the worst examples of handling the pandemic due to its inefficiency married
     with militarism threaded throughout its responses. It is a bleak one marred by a totalitarian
     streak and the people’s increased realization that the state is more intent on filling jails.
     The global crisis is first and foremost a public health issue. Nonetheless, Philippine’s
     President Rodrigo Duterte has faced the Coronavirus pandemic in a decidedly militaristic
     fashion. The President also had a message for anyone who intended to repeat the action of San
     Roque residents (leftists): <i>“I will not hesitate. My orders are to the police and
     military, as well as village officials if there are any trouble, or occasions where there’s
     violence and your lives are in danger: shoot them dead.”</i>

     In the time when we should be saving lives, people are being killed either by incompetence
	 or by the bullet. In a country already heavily afflicted with the COVID-19 pandemic, this
	 senseless killings shows the inconsiderate of the Duterte administration and his failed
	 leadership to solve the root of this problem which is the poverty, inequality of the people
	 in our nation, and misplaced priorities of our government spending resources to hunt down
	 activists while thousands of our countrymen are dying because of hunger or the virus. Hence,
	 they should have minimized their militarism on handling this pandemic because people will only
	 be more afraid than they are now. As a matter of fact, there are alternatives and programs
	 to discipline people without being militaristic to the extent of killing and shaming violators.

<p align="center">
     If our country’s government will be more solicitous and mindful hereafter, the<br>
	 Philippines will be more stable in terms of environment and economic growth and will<br>
	 rapidly decrease the cases of COVID-19 supposing that the Government’s administration and management of<br>
	 the pandemic will not prioritize the subject matter, militarism. Additionally, if the nation's<br>
	 government implements the less militaristic response to this crisis, it will appease and<br>
	 will grant the community's protection than them being threatened by the government's<br>
	 manipulation with the pandemic.
	 <p>
	 <br>
	 <br>
<p align=center">
     In summary, the government should know their priorities and be aware of their incompetence
	 in responding to the prior mentioned crisis. The battle against COVID-19 is not just a battle
	 for the government of the Philippines yet a collective fight for every Filipino. Thus, the
	 cooperation, relationship, and discipline of every Filipino, as well as the government in
	 respecting and following the mandated precautionary measures prescribed by the authorities along
	 with focusing on the primary issue rather than of militarism, are the most significant in
	 determining factors in the country’s battle against COVID-19.</font>

AN IMAGE OF HOPE</b></h1></font>

<font size="5">
The year 2020 has been one extraordinary year. It made humanity question and realize a lot of things and proved that wealth is nothing without health. 
As another year begins, it is important to be grateful that with all the things that have happened in the past year, we are still here alive and continuing to survive. As a member of the Social Action Office of the City Bacolod, we would like to spread a message of hope in order to start this New Year right.

The <b>anchor</b> is a <i>Symbol of hope and steadfastness</i>. In ancient times, the anchor was a <i>symbol of safety</i>. <b>Christ</b> is the <i>anchor of Christianity</i> and he preached hope to people. According to the Epistle to the Hebrews <i>“Hope... is an anchor of the soul, sure and firm” (Hebrews 6:19-20)</i>. The anchor holds Christians steady to the hope of eternal salvation. Everytime the anchor rises, a new voyage will begin. They will explore and enjoy another journey!

<i>“He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.” (Revelation 21:4)
<p align="center">
“Have no anxiety at all; but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God.” (Philippians 4:6)</i>

Ms. Alicia P. Catabay once said that; <i>“At the end of the day all we need is hope and strength. Hope that it will eventually get better and strength to hold on till it does,”</i>. And while we are waiting; whatever hardship, challenges, indecisions, and fears that we are facing, we just remember that these too shall pass and by the grace of God we will overcome. You might have lost someone you treasure so much, or you might be struggling to survive or to live, however all of those will be part of paragraphs in a book filled with your own journey. This means the end of that page is just there somewhere, so do not lose faith and keep hoping no matter what. Also, always remember that no matter where you are, who you are and what your situation is, may our powerful God grant you courage and strength. May you never give up because it may be hard today, but no one knows what tomorrow holds. 
<p>

“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.”
Whatever you do, don’t be discouraged. Keep moving, keep being productive. Keep your head up because we will come out stronger on the other side, and we will be ready to fight whatever the future holds for us.<p>
<p align="center">
We shall never lose hope for every journey have its own end. Every situation, may it be positive or negative, they would pass by and will only be part of history someday. That is why we pray that everyone, no matter where you are, who you are, and what your situation is, may our Powerful God grant you courage and strength. May you never give up because it may be hard today, but no one knows what tomorrow holds.<p>
<p align="center">
In face of life's most difficult circumstances and greatest tragedies, we can trust the Lord. We can persevere in the confident expectation that we're not alone or forgotten. He will never abandon us.<p>
<p align="center">
Don't lose hope and don't give up even in these troubling times. Continue to reach for the light. Everything will be alright. I wish you all good health and a good spirit during these troubled times. Take care, stay safe and be well!<p>
<p align="center">
Even if there are moments in our life where it is tainted by despair, we can overcome that despair with our own hope along the obstacles we pass. Moving forward with strength in our hearts makes us the person that we are. The first step on having hope is to truly believe in yourself.<p>
